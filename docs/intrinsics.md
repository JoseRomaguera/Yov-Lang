# Intrinsics

## Introduction

Intrinsics are built-in functions provided by the language for utilities, operating system interactions, and performance-critical operations.

See [core.yov](../code/core.yov) for the definitions.

> ⚠️ Work in progress! While some intrinsics are self-explanatory, detailed documentation will be added in the future.
