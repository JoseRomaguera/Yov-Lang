[ ] Create public repo


# WHY?

- Less dependencies than a compiled language
- Reliable execution between systems, no dependencies other than yov.exe
- Analyze code before execution (does not ocur to general purpuse interpreters)
- Optional user assertion mode to don't messing files and folders while creating a script
- Powerfull intrinsics
- No memory management needed
- Syntactic sugar for batch files:
	- ? :)
- Smallest dependency: Yov.exe weights less than 100kb
- No setup for executing yav files


# MILESTON FOR 1.0

- Foreach: Array
- Float
- Modulo operator
- Signs: v = -v
- Allow expresions inside string literals
- Allow special characters inside string literals: \", \{, \}, \\
- Structs
- Improve error messages
	- En reports, sportar {line}
- Foreach: Files
- Functions
- Include other files
- Every Yov call have a Int return
- Intrinsics
	- Common File System
	- Common String utils
	- Common Path utils
	- Execute other Yav scripts
- Globals
	- OS-System with info
		- OSType: Windows, Linux, MacOS
		- CPUArch: 32 - 64 bits
	- Context
		- User Assertion Mode: None, Console, MessageBox
		- Current Dir
		- Args
		- Environment variables
- What about user permisions??
- Garbage Collector
- Write documentation
- Add "help" argument

# IDEAS

- "Any" variable type
- Robust error defines and management
